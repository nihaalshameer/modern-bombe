This project proposes a novel enhancement to AI hardware using the logic-reduction principle behind Alan Turing's Bombe.

Inspired by Turingâ€™s work on breaking Enigma, we simulate a system that reduces logical possibilities in ASIC chips. This could boost AI and crypto chip efficiency by 2%, with potential savings over $300 million globally.

This research is being developed as part of a self-study project by a JEE Advanced aspirant looking to enter the AI engineering space with deep logic roots.
