# Bombe-Inspired Logic Layer: Impact Example

## Scenario:
A modern AI ASIC or crypto ASIC performs:
- **1,000,000,000 guesses/second** (1 billion/sec)

By implementing a Bombe-inspired **invalid guess elimination logic layer** (PL Layer), we can:
- **Skip ~1% of impossible paths early**

## Result:
- **10,000,000 operations per second are avoided**
- These 10 million operations would otherwise activate logic gates, consume power, and delay pipeline stages

## Efficiency Gain:
- Even skipping just 1% of guesses leads to:
  - Lower **thermal output**
  - Reduced **wear** on silicon
  - Less **electricity used per chip per cycle**
  - Slight increase in **throughput capacity**

## Energy Savings at Scale:
- If deployed across a farm of 100,000 ASICs:
  - **1 trillion fewer gates toggle per second**
  - Multiplies into real-world savings of **$20â€“$40 million/year** in large-scale systems, depending on electricity costs

## Key Insight:
Small reductions in logic activity scale **massively** in global computing.  
This justifies investment in **logic-level filtering** techniques like Bombe-inspired modules.
