# Gigiplate: Bombe-Inspired AI Logic Enhancement

This project explores a modern interpretation of Alan Turing’s "Bombe" logic system applied to AI hardware. We propose an architecture that improves ASIC chip performance in crypto-mining and AI logic inference.

## 🧠 Abstract
By simulating logical path reduction similar to the Bombe machine, a 2% global efficiency boost is possible in specialized AI chips. This could result in a net benefit of $328 million USD if adopted across leading data centers.
