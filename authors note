## ✍️ Author Note

This idea was discovered and developed independently by the author at the age of **16**, while preparing for the JEE Advanced 2027 exam. The author has no institutional research support and created this project through personal effort, combining inspiration from Alan Turing’s work with a vision for future AI hardware efficiency.

This project reflects the author’s desire to bridge **historical genius with modern engineering**, starting from a small hostel room in India — with global impact in mind.
